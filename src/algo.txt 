a number in stake_a  < range  -> push to b and rotate b   , then increment the start

same  == push to b , do nothing increment the start  

  same   > range  -> rotate a 

now we in b

1 - bubble sort the stake_a.
2 - define a part from the bubble_sorted_a.
3 - check if the top of stake_a in in the defined part , if valid , then push to stake_b and increment the range start (0->5 became 1 -> 6 ).
4 - if the top of the stake_a is bigger than the defined range then reverse rotate or rotate depening on where the expected number to be found.
5 - if the numbers is in a place fewer than the range , then : push to B and rotate B . and increment the start . (0->5 became 1 -> 6 ).
6 - check for the bigger one in B and push to a.
